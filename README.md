### Project Overview

this data analysis project aims to provide insights into the amount spent on health insurance by individuals and families over the years. By analysing various aspect of the health insurance data set, i seek to identify trends and pattern and gain deeper understanding how people prioritize their health.

 individuals and families.

Data Cleaning
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following task:
1. Data Formating.
2. Removed Duplicates.
3. Trimmed the data to avoid unecessary spaces.
4. Used Upper case function for the data.
5. Handled missing values.
6. Used "isnumber" function to confirm if the columns with numerical values are error free.
7. Used the "find and replace" function to change the indication of "yes" and "no" for the smoker column to "smoker" and "non-smoker" respectively.
   
### Explanatory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the health insurance data to answer key question, such as:

- What is the total amount spent by individuals and families on health insurance combined?
- Which gender and the age range that spend more on health insurance simultaneously?
- Which region spend more on health insurance?
- Who is more involved in health insurance between smokers and non-smokers?
- the amount people of a various weight range sepnd on health insurance?
- Which couples with children spend more on health insurance?

### Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. From the data below it shows that people spend alot of money to insurance their health which show that people take their health very seriously
as the old saying goes, health is wealth.
2. In terms of age and gender,men between the age of 48-57 take their health insurance very seriously as they spend more on insuring their health.
3. The region that is most involed in health insurance is the southeast region.
4. Non-smokers spends more on insuring their health.
5. People who weight between 25.96-35.96 are more actively involved in health insurance.
6. Couples with no children show the most interest in insuring their health.


### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, i advice the following action:
- smokers should spend health insurance more seriously as they are pron to health issues.
- couples with children should prioritise the health of their children.

### Limitation
i had to remove all zero values of the charges column because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusion from the analysis.
